### TODO List
API for displaying the entries
WEB website that has the functionality to display the videos (maybe a calendar to easily find what you want to watch)
PYTHON, do we need this python script to detect motion?
How should i deliver this video feed?
 - post it to the python script from rasp
 - get it from the rasp livestream
